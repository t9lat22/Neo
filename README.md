## ⚠️ Important

To **add more games** to your Neo site:

1. Visit the [🎮 Ultimate Game Stash](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FmH3BlSBQI7FGgAQL59-ZPe8eCxs35wel6JUyVaG8Q/edit?tab=t.0).  
2. Choose a game you’d like to add.  
3. Copy its **embed or HTML code** and create a **new file** inside the `/g/` folder (for example: `/g/newgame.html`).  
4. For game logos or cover art, simply find images on **Google Images** or upload your own.

💡 *Tip:* Keep game filenames simple (like `slope.html` or `flappybird.html`) so they’re easy to organize and link from your homepage.
